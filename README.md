# Description
This app serves as the client-side of the movie_api I wrote earlier. It was built using React and built with Parcel.

To start the dev server first install

```bash
npm install --save react react-dom

npm install --save-dev babel-preset-react babel-preset-env

npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-class-properties
```

then run
